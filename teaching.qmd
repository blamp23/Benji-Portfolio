### VTPP 438 — Analysis of Genomic Signals

**Fall 2024 — Teaching Assistant**  
*Department of Veterinary Physiology & Pharmacology (Dr. Ivan Ivanov)*  

I co-designed an **introductory R curriculum** for microarray analysis and mentored students on:

- Loading and preprocessing expression sets  
- Differential expression with **limma**  
- Building reproducible, well-documented workflows in **R Markdown**

The goal was not just mastering software, but cultivating reproducible-science habits.
