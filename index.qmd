## Howdy, y’all! I'm **Benji Lamp**

Welcome to my website! Here you’ll find a snapshot of who I am, the research I’m working on, and any news worth sharing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A quick back-story

I’m originally from **Plano, Texas**, but my passion for **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology** really took off in College Station while earning the **Biomedical Research Certificate** at Texas A&M. Through the Vet School, I dove into large transcriptomic datasets and haven’t looked back.

### Oregon ties

These days I also spend time collaborating with the **Karstens Lab** in Oregon, improving our long-read 16S rRNA sequencing pipelines to better understand the **female urinary microbiome**.

### What’s next

I’m now based in **Houston** and kicking off a Ph.D. in **Dr. David Hala’s lab** at **Texas A&M Galveston**, using a systems-toxicology lens to study **PFAS (“forever chemicals”)** in zebrafish models.

Thanks to a **Hagler Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship**, I’ll also be mentored by **Dr. Robyn Tanguay** of **Oregon State University**, one of the world’s leading zebrafish scientist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ever need a hand with sequence-processing pipelines (or just want to chat all things -omics) feel free to reach out. I’m always looking to take on new skills and collaborations.
