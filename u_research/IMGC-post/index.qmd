# Intro 

In october _date_, I was invited to come speak at the International Milk Genomics Consortium Symposium over the work that Dr. Rijnkels and I have been doing related to expression patterns of genes in holstein fresian cattle over a timecourse. I was blessed to recive a travel award by the IMGC in order to get to Davis California. 
This was my first academic conference that I have ever attended. My presentation went... okay. Just being blunt, this was the most people I have ever had to present to, so my presentation was a bit shaky, but we got a bunch of good feedback that will hopefully be included in the final paper. 

In addition to visiting Davis, I got the chance to meet my dad in San Franscisco, as he does a lot of work in tech, my mom caught a flight as well, and we all had a fun weekend exploring San Fransisco, and stopping by a couple of wineries in Napa. Definitley visiting again!
