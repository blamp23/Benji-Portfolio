# Benji's Portfolio

This repo contains the source for my personal site built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The site is published from the `docs/` folder using GitHub Pages.

## Updating the site

- **Navigation and settings**: edit `_quarto.yml`.
- **Blog posts**: add a new folder under `posts/` with an `index.qmd`, then run `quarto render` to rebuild.
- **Graduate research**: files in `g_research/`.
- **Undergraduate research**: files in `u_research/`.
- **Teaching**: edit `teaching.qmd`.
- **Build locally**: `quarto render` updates the `docs/` directory; commit the changes and push to deploy.
